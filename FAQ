 No Doubt - FAQ

 Frequently Asked Questions
 --------------------------

 1) What is this program for?

 In short, No Doubt is a stupid and lame webserver.  For more information, read
 the README.

 2) Why does it suck so badly?

 No Doubt sucks so much because I made it in half a day.  I'm not a very good
 programmer.  I'm not David Anderson.  That jerk.

 3) Is is secure?

 It is only slightly more secure than Windows.

 4) How do I get better performance?

 Get a better computer with a better network connection.  It's true.  That's
 what Dave would say.  Well, I guess you can mess around with the chunk size
 (-c) and timeout (-t) options.  A higher chunk size seems to be the best way
 to increase throughput.  Also, if you totally disable logging (just remove the
 printf statements), that can increase performance as well.

 UPDATE (2005-07-03): I added a new flag (-v) so you can set what verbosity
 level (i.e. how much logging) you want to take place.  Pretty snazzy.  If you
 don't want any sort of logging, then don't pass a log file argument.  Reducing
 the verbosity can affect the performance of the system, but it shouldn't be
 that big of a deal.  Errors, of course, are always printed to stderr.

 5) Will you continue development of this?

 Probably not, unless someone emails me and tells me I'm cool and how this
 program has changed their life.

 UPDATE (2005-07-03): I'm bored and don't want to work on the project I'm paid
 to do (can't talk about that... NDA).  Also, I tend to get amused by simple
 things like my program hosting web pages, so until I get tired of this (like a
 week), I'll keep on working on No Doubt.  Maybe I'll even put it in the Open
 Source Graveyard (i.e. Source Forge) and let it bit rot there when I lose my
 interest.

 6) I like the idea of a small webserver like No Doubt.  Are there any other
 projects (i.e good ones)?

 For real select(2) based servers, written by smart people, look for tinyhttpd,
 or lighttpd.  The latter has become really popular as of late and includes
 many advanced features.  I didn't use any code from those projects or even use
 them because I'm too stupid and lazy to bother.  I just half-assed my own
 server (WTF?). Exactly.

 7) How does No Doubt compare to other webservers?

 For the most part, No Doubt is as fast and responsive as other servers, if not
 faster.  The only things that distinguish it are: 
 
 -  It readily supports files larger than 2GB
 -  It has a very small memory footprint and uses very little CPU
 -  Is readable and very simple (i.e. you can learn some basic things)
 -  It is NOT meant for commercial/enterprise work (only for small activities)

 8) Who's David Anderson?

 The best programmer I know.  That jerk.
