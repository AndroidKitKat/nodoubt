 Introduction
 ------------

 No Doubt is a small, inefficient, insecure, and lame webserver that is
 designed to do only one thing:

			SERVE BIG ASS FILES (ie. > 2 GB)

 Any other features that this poor excuse of a webserver might have is simply
 the cherry on top of a fugly cupcake (WTF?).  Exactly. 

 One nice feature (probably the only one) is that because it uses select(2)
 instead of pthreads, it is very fast and lightweight.  On top of this, the
 source code is meant to be as readable as possible and whenever a decision
 about choosing between efficiency and readability comes up, readability will
 always win out.  If anything, this source is a pretty decent jumping off point
 to learn about using select(2) or making a web server.  You have to be on
 crack to use this in a production environment.  Like me.

 SERIOUS NOTE: This webserver is really, really, really, REALLY INSECURE. It
 will allow people to access any files the specified directory (including any
 subfolders).  Although I did try to put in some security checks, I am lazy and
 didn't try that hard.  If you get pwn3d, don't say I didn't warn you.

 Install
 -------

 You will need a decent Unix operating system like NetBSD or Arch Linux. Untar
 the tarball and then compile with make.  You can then put the executable
 anywhere in your path (i.e /usr/local/bin).

 Example:

 > tar -xzvf nodoubt-0.0.1.tar.gz
 > make
 > sudo cp nodoubt /usr/local/bin

 Usage
 -----
 
 Usage: nodoubt [options...] 

 In order for the program to know what files it should be serving, you can pass
 it a directory option (-d).  Otherwise, the program will default to the
 current directory.

 Example:

 > ./nodoubt -d /pub/video

 For a complete list of command line arguments, simply pass the -h flag.

 Dedication
 ----------

 This program is dedicated to my friend David Anderson.  Although I don't
 support your ripping of DVDs, I will aid your "liberation" effort so I can
 watch some of them (WTF?).  Exactly.
